BUILDING libTS
=====

To Build:
--------
Let BUILD be the directory and SRC be the source directory.
Its best if BUILD is not same as SRC

Adjust following variables in $SRC/standalone.cmake
Default are given below. Cmake unfortunately is unable to find this or
more likely I am not skilled enough to make it find these automatically.

set(NUMPY_SRC /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/f2py/src/)
set(NUMPY_INCLUDE /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/core/include/)
set(PYTHON_INCLUDE /usr/local/include/python2.7 )

Then do following commands:

For BASH:	  
  
  mkdir BUILD
  export CC=mpicc;export CXX=mpicxx;export FC=mpif90 (or equivalent in other shells)
  cd BUILD
  cmake -DCOMPILER_FAMILY=<gnu,intel,portland> -DINSTALL_DIR=<installation_directory> -DMACHINE=<yellowstone,norgay,linux> SRC
  make -j4
  make install 

For CSH:

  mkdir BUILD
  setenv CC=mpicc;setenv CXX=mpicxx;setenv FC=mpif90 
  cd BUILD
  cmake -DCOMPILER_FAMILY=<gnu,intel,portland> -DINSTALL_DIR=<installation_directory> -DMACHINE=<yellowstone,norgay,linux> SRC
  make -j4
  make install

Here is the example I used from my csh_history
     2225  mkdir BUILD
     2226  cd BUILD/
     2227  setenv CC=mpicc;setenv CXX=mpicxx;setenv FC=mpif90;
     2228  cmake -DCOMPILER_FAMILY=intel -DMACHINE=norgay ..
     2229  make -j4
     2230  make install

Note:
If COMPILER_FAMILY is not specified it is assumed as "gnu"
If INSTALL_DIR is not specified it is assumed as BUILD/cart
If MACHINE is not specified it is assumed as yellowstone (to be fully automated shortly)
